Hi! ðŸ‘€ I am Shujun Liu (åˆ˜ä¹¦éš½), a first-year graduate at the School of Data Science, [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/). I am a member of the [Fudan NLP Group](https://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/nlpen/main.htm) and Data Intelligence and Social Computing Lab ([DISC Lab](http://www.fudan-disc.com/)).

My work spans Natural Language Processing and Multi-modal Learning. Iâ€™m particularly excited about these research thrusts:
* ðŸ¤– Reasoning Models. 
* ðŸ“¸ Vision-language Modality Alignment.
